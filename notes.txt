use js to randomize text colors, text size, font family, font weight, bg colors, text transformations, text decorations
--js was already included for these items, it was just commented out
isBold only adds bold and normal, need to add 400 and 700

-first attempt at turn in failed: failed because js was not the point css is,  will attempt again

-use replit and codepen
---replit now charges, when did that happen????

transform is already set by the code -- what makes the squares squew
-we need to set everything that was commented out:
borderColor
borderToPosition  - top or bottom
positionOffsetValue - number to go with top or bottom.
color
fontSize
fontWeight
textDecoration
textTransform
fontFamily
backgroundColor

-border-color wasn't working, 
--because the border was only defined in the .word > span style.
---added span to all the css styles
